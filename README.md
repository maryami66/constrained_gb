This toolbox is for applying constrained optimization with gradient boosting model. It is written under Sklearn gradient boosting.
To see how it works, see the example folder, breast_cancer.py.
To see the provided constraints, see the "gradient_boosting_constrained_optimization" folder, _constraints.py
